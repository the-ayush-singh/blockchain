### It utilizes Basic JS concepts(OOPs, Arrow Functions, Modules,etc..) arranged in a logical way.
Node Js Programming Lanuage is used here.

## Here we're generating Blocks with their unique Hashes using (SHA 256)

## Testing all the commits(like Blockchain Validation, Mining function, etc)! Just to be On safe Sides ðŸ˜€
Here NodeMon is used to Leverage auto run facility

## Creating and Testing APIs using POSTMAN

## Linked various peers through websocket and SYNC the Blockchain

# PROOF OF WORK

## Adding difficulty to the Blockchain so that it cannot be exploited. 
### We can see that at DIFFICULTY = 4 there are four zeros in the beginning of the Hash
With  DIFFICULTY = 4 the time taken to generate the block is about 4 sec.

## With DIFFICULTY = 5 there are five (0)s in the begining of the Hash and Time taken to generate the Block is about 47s.

Therefore we can observe that time increases exponentially as difficulty increases, therefore DIFFICULTY helps the Blockchain to prevent its exploitation! As more and more resource of the MINER will be utilised for mining the chain. Therefore if someone wants to replace the whole chain they will need about 51% power of the total Blockchain system and even after doing so it won't be worth it.

## Generating a Blockchain with Dynamic DIFFICULTY
Here difficulty is varying according to the time taken by previous Block production.
